SQL: SQL databases are known as "relational" databases, meaning different types of data are stored in different tables. 
Records in a table can have references to records in other tables, called a relationship. Relationships are the essence of SQL
databases. This allows SQL to store data more efficiently. But on the other hand, this introduces overhead for querying.

NoSQL: All databases that do not follow the rules of SQL are collectively referred to as "NoSQL". There are many designs of NoSQL.
Since NoSQL does not have the concept of relationship, it is usually less compact than SQL since there are duplicate information. 
However, this may bring some benefit in query performance.
